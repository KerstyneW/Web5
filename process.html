        <h3> Picking a Topic </h3>
        <p>
          Our initial topic idea was designing a web application, using Experience Builder, to display
          nesting and wetland habitats of Blanding's Turtles on the South Shore of Prince Edward County.
          This is the topic of our groups collaborative project and we thought that it'd be nice to get a
          head start. <br> However, after discussing it with Shawn and within the group we decided on changing
          our topic to be Tourism in Prince Edward County instead. Tourism data was more readily available,
          and we were still able to experiement with Experience Builder, the application we will be using during
          our collab.

    <h3> Web Map </h3>
    <p> 
      Experience Builder requires external data to fill the 'map' portion of its interface. Our group created the map 
      from all of our tourism data layers within ArcGIS Online. <br>
      1. Layers were added to a new map using Map Viewer in ArcGIS Online - The Wineries, Parks, Museums, Heritage Buildings, Trails, Golf Courses, Monuments,
      Picnic Areas, and Visitor Information layers were all added into a new web map. <br>
      2. Base map was selected - Our group decided to use the Topographic Basemap because it provided context while not distracting from the content
      we were trying to highlight. <br>
      3. Symbology was altered for each layer - Each feature layers style was changed to one that best depicted while still being cohesive with the rest.
      We settled on pictorial symbols for each layer; Wineries layer were depicted by grapes within a circle, Parks layer was depicted by trees within a circle
      etc. <br>
      4. Attribute table data was edited for pop-ups - For our collaborative project our client wants pop-ups for information, therefore, we wanted to incorporate
      that into this project to get practise. Attribute table data was altered within the "Configure Fields" tab in Map Viewer so that field names were displayed
      as desired and then the "Configure pop-ups" tab, also within Map Viewer, was used to include only the fields that the public would need access to in the
      pop-ups. <br>
      All edits made were done so that the map would have intuitive symbology and a user-friendly experience.
